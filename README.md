A simple and elegant web-based Pomodoro Timer to help you boost productivity and manage your time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique.

## 📖 About

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.

This application provides a clean and intuitive interface to implement this proven productivity method.
